DESCRIPTION :
             The provided Java code, "StudentGradeTracker," is a straightforward program designed to calculate the average grade and assign a corresponding letter grade based on input marks for multiple subjects. Here's an in-depth description of its functionality and structure:

1. **Input Handling**: The program utilizes the `Scanner` class to capture user input from the console. Users are prompted to enter the number of subjects, and then they input the marks for each subject one by one.

2. **Data Storage**: The marks for each subject are stored in an integer array called `subjectMarks`, with the array size dynamically allocated based on the number of subjects entered by the user. This ensures that all entered marks are accounted for and accessible for further processing.

3. **Calculation of Total Marks**: As the user enters the marks for each subject, the program iterates through the array, accumulating the total marks in the `totalMarks` variable. This step is essential for calculating the average grade later in the program.

4. **Average Grade Calculation**: After collecting all marks, the program calculates the average grade by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects. The result is stored in the `averageGrade` variable, ensuring accuracy in assessing the overall performance across all subjects.

5. **Letter Grade Assignment**: Based on the calculated average grade, the program assigns a letter grade to represent the overall performance. This is achieved using conditional statements (if-else), where different score ranges correspond to specific letter grades (A, B, C, D).

6. **Output Display**: Finally, the program presents the calculated average grade and the corresponding letter grade to the user via console output. This feedback provides users with a clear understanding of their academic performance across the subjects entered.

While the program serves its purpose of tracking student grades and providing feedback, it does have limitations. For instance, it lacks advanced features such as error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values) and customization options (e.g., weighted grading). Additionally, it operates solely through command-line interaction, lacking a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user experience.

In summary, "StudentGradeTracker" offers a basic yet functional solution for calculating and assessing student grades across multiple subjects. With further enhancements such as error handling and GUI integration, it could become a more versatile and user-friendly tool for academic evaluation.

SUMMARY :
         The Java program "StudentGradeTracker" is a simple tool for calculating and evaluating student grades based on user input. It prompts users to enter the number of subjects and the marks for each subject. Then, it calculates the average grade and assigns a letter grade based on predefined criteria. The program utilizes the Scanner class for input handling and stores marks in an array. It calculates the total marks and averages them to determine the overall grade. Finally, it displays the average grade and the corresponding letter grade to the user. While functional, the program lacks advanced features such as error handling and a graphical user interface. Overall, "StudentGradeTracker" provides a basic yet effective solution for tracking student grades, with potential for further enhancements to improve usability and functionality.
